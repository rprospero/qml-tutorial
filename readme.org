* QML Tutorial

This repo is a tutorial set for understanding using QML with Python
for creating GUIs.  Python was chosen due to its status as a modern
/lingua franca/ of coding, but the concepts apply to [[https://wiki.qt.io/Language_Bindings][dozens of
languages]].  In fact, the QML files allows changing the backend
implementation language without making any changes to the interface.

* Hello World

This folder contains a minimal example of QML code.  Any QML code that
does not require work from the Python backend can be loaded from this
Python example.

- [[file:home/view.qml][view.qml]] :: A QML file displaying a simple greeting
- [[file:home/main.py][main.py]] :: The python script to display a QML file

Run the example

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python3 main.py
#+END_SRC

* Compute Stats

This folder starts the journey of interacting between QML and Python.
The module will load a file of X and Y values and display various
statistics through numpy.
